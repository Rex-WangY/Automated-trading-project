# Automated-trading-project
Our GitHub project aims to build a collaborative platform for managing financial asset data, predictive modeling, and automated trading. Tailored for myself and my spouse, it supports her expertise in stock and financial asset price forecasting, while I handle data acquisition, cleaning, and trading automation.
